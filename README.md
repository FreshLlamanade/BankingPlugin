# BankingPlugin

A Minecraft plugin for earning interest on your items.

This plugin is an extension on typical economy plugins (currently only compatible with EssentialsX) that allows for the creation of physical banks and bank accounts. A player may deposit items into their bank account by simply entering the bank building and placing the items in their account chest (similar to a safe deposit box). The value of those items, and thus the balance of the account, will be calculated in a manner consistent with the Worth.yml file in EssentialsX. Players will then periodically earn a portion of that value back in the form of eco-currency.

# Using BankingPlugin
BankingPlugin is designed to work on Spigot versions 1.15.2 and 1.16.1. However, there are relatively few signs that the plugin should not be compatible with earlier versions of Minecraft. Usage on unsupported versions should nevertheless be treated with caution.
BankingPlugin requires **Java 8 or above** to work.
